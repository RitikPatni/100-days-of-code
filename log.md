### Day 6: June 15,2017

**Today's Progress:** Done with the twitch and now moving on to intermediate algorithm section.

**Thoughts:** Twitch TV was a tough one for me but an error of single '  "  ' (DOUBLE INVERTED COMMA) made it a lot more tougher(took me 2 days to figure it out).

### Day 7: June 16,2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed the first three problems from the intermediate algorithm section.

### Day 8: June 17,2017
